    <p>Mikal Morgan "Mo" Murrey passed from this world on August 6, 2011 at the age of 31 in Lewisville, TX. He will be missed by all the many family and friends who loved him. He was born January 7, 1980 in Dallas, TX. Mo worked in the Technology department of The Village Church in Flower Mound, TX. He loved his job and everyone he worked with. The Village Church was also his spiritual home. The congregation welcomed him with open arms and he was able to continue and grow in the Lord. Mo helped establish a Home Group of men who belonged to the church and lived close to him as well. This group became a great source of strength for him and his greatest source of inspiration in his efforts to grow closer to God. Mo had other sides to him as well. There was nothing technical he could not fix. For everyone at work, and outside of work, he was the go-to guy for everything. He had this knack of just figuring things out and fixing anything, including flat tires. To know Mo was to love him. Selfless, kind and loving are the three words that most often to come to mind when describing him. But he was also funny and had a fabulous sense of humor. When you saw Mo laugh or smile, you couldn’t help but do it back. He loved to teach anyone who wanted to learn. In one of the comments left about him, someone said he was always being followed by a line of teens and kids wanting to learn something. He often gave the smaller children a “very important job” as he taught the older ones all sorts of technical information while teaching them even more important life lessons. So many young people will look back and say they learned more than computer things from Mo. He is survived by his parents Mikal and Margaret Murrey, his sister Michelle Murrey, his grandmother Elizabeth Zwaska and various aunts, uncles and cousins. He also leaves behind his dogs Higgins and Maggie. Those dogs meant everything, everything to him. And of course, countless friends. There are so many people will miss him so very much. Mo’s memorial service will be held on Monday, August 15 at 2pm at The Village Church Flower Mound campus. The church’s address is <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?daddr=2101+Justin+Rd,+Flower+Mound,+TX+75028&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=33.070291,-97.060378&amp;sspn=0.012102,0.022724&amp;geocode=Cd9ekWXcb9jDFdOc-AEd5vk2-ikvhOL-jzJMhjHnXLkk0NDksA&amp;mra=ls&amp;z=16" target="_blank" title="Click for Directions">2101 Justin Road, Flower Mound, TX 75028</a>. It will be followed by a reception. Please call the church at&nbsp;972-537-1100&nbsp;with any questions. In lieu of flowers please make any donations to the <a href="https://donations.childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/" target="_blank">Children’s Miracle Network</a>.</p>
<p>We wish to thank all the people who loved, taught, touched and helped make Mo’s life better. Always remember his love, kindness and laughter. Let that be the legacy he left to all of us.</p>
<p>This small quote below from his favorite movie <em>Empire Records</em> sums up Mo well:<br />
<em>
“Well outlaw man, we salute you.”</em></p>
